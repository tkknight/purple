# This file contains the list of components.
# Each component must include two keys: settings, aspect_effects.
# Every instance of settings must include 3 keys: min, max, increments.
#   These are used to generate an array of all possible settings for that component.
# Every instance of aspect_effects must contain identical keys.
#   Each item therein denotes the percentage effect on each aspect of increasing the component from min to max.
